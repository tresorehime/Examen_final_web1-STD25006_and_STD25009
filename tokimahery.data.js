  aboutMe_part1: `I am a PhD researcher studying complex systems through agent-based modeling and simulation. However, teaching, is my Ikigai, it is driven by a deep commitment to helping students grow beyond what they thought possible.`,

  aboutMe_part2: `It is not an accessory to my work — it is its foundation and its energy. Research sharpens my thinking; the classroom gives it meaning. And as a developer, I turn ideas into clean, reliable software built to last.`,
